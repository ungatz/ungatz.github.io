After my recent attempt to learn the core of category theory and exploration of Saunders Mac Lane's insightful books. I have
tried to organize my notes, thoughts and highlights in this post. The post is divided into
two parts, origins of category theory are covered in the first one, next comes the core machinery for working with
categories.
* Origins
Mathematics is said to have its origins in the "human cultural activities" as Mac Lane put it. These activities lead
to notions of some ideas like the activity of observing leads to a notion of the "symmetry" of objects and this
general idea of "symmetry" is formalized as a symmetry group of figures or formulae (which defined on an infinite set
becomes a transformation group). This
perspective comes from the intuitionists who argue that mathematics is a human construct not an objective truth, that
is to say there would be no math without the brain. The /idea/ which has its origins in the activities is said to have some
intuitive content which can then be /formalized./ By /formal/ we mean a list of rules or of axioms or of methods of proof which can be applied without attention to the "meaning" but which give results which do have the correct interpretation.
#+BEGIN_CENTER
  | Activity  | Idea     | Formalization             |
  |-----------+----------+---------------------------|
  | Argue     | Proof    | Logical Connectives       |
  | Choosing  | Chance   | Probability               |
  | Counting  | Next     | Successor; Ordinal Number |
  | Observing | Symmetry | Transformation Group      |
#+END_CENTER
If we consider Mathematics to be the science of number and space then we can construct some formal notions. It is the morphosis of fact to form.
*** What is idea of the formal?
- To describe the /idea/ of the /formal/ a few basic mathematical structures are required. To put this in context here's a
  quote from Mac Lane, "With Bourbaki, we hold that Mathematics deals with such "mother structures". Against the
  historical order, we hold that they arise directly from the *basic stuff* of Mathematics."
- These mother structures include sets, transformations, groups, order and topology. These are the building blocks of
  more complex structures that evolve within Mathematics.
** Where does category theory come from?
- Category Theory originates from the distaste in set theory by mathematicians. Set theory is convenient and enough to
  describe almost all mathematical objects. Therefore, as a foundation for mathematics set theory is widely accepted with
  a condition that we must live with /formally undecidable theorems/. Moreover, the word "set" is not really defined because of the
  circular nature and we also need to have ZF Axioms to get around paradoxes. ZF axioms do not settle the continuum
  hypothesis i.e it holds for some models and doesn't for others.
- There are relations (like membership) on sets which can also be nicely done using composition of functions.
  This leads to an alternate foundation for mathematics using categories.
** Category Theory as a foundation for mathematics
We are able to use set theory as a /foundation/ for primarily because essentially all of mathematics reduces to sets.
Another way to look at this is instead of looking at mathematics as a whole it's better viewed as its *objects* and
*mappings* between them. This approach works for a lot of branches of mathematics,
  | Branch             | Objects              | Morphisms/Mappings         |
  |--------------------+----------------------+----------------------------|
  | Set Theory         | Sets                 | Functions                  |
  | Topology           | Topological Spaces   | Continuos Maps             |
  | Groups             | Groups               | Homomorphisms              |
  | Euclidean Geometry | Inned Product Spaces | Orthogonal Transformations |
* Machinery Of Category Theory
** What is a Category?
- A *category* $\mathbf{C}$ consists of
  + a collection of objects: $A$, $B$, $C$,
  + a collection of arrows: $f$, $g$, $h$,
  + for each arrow $f$ objects $\mathrm{dom}_{f}$ and $\mathrm{cod}_{f}$ called the *domain* and *codomain* of $f$. If $\mathrm{dom}_{f}=A$ and $\mathrm{cod}_{f}=B$, we also write $f :A\to B$,
    - given $f :A\to B$ and $g :B\to C$ , so that $\mathrm{dom}_{g}=\mathrm{cod}_{f}$, there is an arrow $g\circ f:A\to C$,
    - an arrow $\mathbf{1}_{A}:A\to A$ for every object $A$ of $\mathbf{C}$,
  + such that following laws are valid,
    - Associative law: for every $f:A\to B$, $g :B\to C$ and $h :C\to C$ we have $h\circ(g\circ f)=(h\circ g)\circ f$.
    - Unit law: for every $f:A\to B$ we have $f\circ\mathbf{1}_{A} = f = \mathbf{1}_{B}\circ f$ where $\mathbf{1}_{A}$ is the identity morphism.
- Since, anything that satisfies this definition is a category we can say that category theory is the abstract algebra
  of arrows.
- To construct a category this question has to be answered, given a mathematical structure what are the morphisms preserving
  this structure? which inturn gives us the arrows of a category.
- In each category $\mathbf{C}$ with two objects $a$ and $b$ there exists a collection,
  #+BEGIN_CENTER
  $hom(a,b) \ = \ \{f \ | \ f \ \text{is an arrow of} \ \mathbf{C} \ \text{and} \ f:a \to b\}$
  #+END_CENTER
  $\textbf{hom-set}$ is not always a set as sometimes it might be /too big/ to be considered under the ZF axioms.
- Examples, of categories,
  + *Set* is a category of sets and set theoretic functions as morphisms. This is a category of mathematical object
    without any structure and since we associate arrows to enforce structure the morphisms in *Set* are special relations
    which themselves are basically /sets/ of input-output pairs.
  + *Opposite Category*, is a category which exists as a dual of any other category. It is constructed by reversing the
    direction of all the arrows in lets say $\mathbf{C}$ and keeping th objects same to get $\mathbf{C}^{op}$. Since,  $\mathbf{C}^{op}$ is
    the dual of $\mathbf{C}^{}$ the product in $\mathbf{C}$ become sum in $\mathbf{C}^{op}$, the terminal object becomes the
    initial and so on.
  + *Product Category*, is a category which is constructed from two categories $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ such that
    the objects in the product category ($\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{D}$) are pairs $\llbracket c,d \rrbracket$ and all the morphisms are pairs
    of arrows i.e for every $f : a \to b$ in $\mathbf{C}$ and $g : a' \to b'$ in $\mathbf{D}$ we have $\langle f,g \rangle$ in
    $\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{D}$.
** Functors
- When we ask "what are morphisms that preserve this structure?" with mathematical structure under considerations as
  /categories/ themselves then the structure preserving morphisms are called functors or covariant functors.  They are arrows between
  categories. This means that categories (/small/ ones) form a category ($\mathbf{Cat}$) with functors as arrows.
- A category itself is a sort of formalization of the intuitive idea of /"structure"/ and as we've seen it has two components viz. objects and morphisms. Similarly, to preserve
  this structure a /functor/ between two categories $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ must also have two component functions,
  + $\mathit{F}_0 : x \ \rightarrow \ F(x)$ where $x \in \mathbf{C}$ and $F(x) \in \mathbf{D}$.
  + $\mathit{F}_1 : f \ \rightarrow \ F(f)$ where $f$ is an arrow in $\mathbf{C}$ as $f: x \to y$ and $F(f)$ is an arrow in $\mathbf{D}$ as $F(f):
    F(x) \to F(y)$.
    - such that for each $x , y \ \in \ Obj(\mathbf{C})$, $F_{x,y} \ : \ \mathbf{C}(x,y) \to (\mathbf{D}(F(x), F(y)))$ between $\textbf{hom-set}s$ such that,
      + it preserve source and targets of morphisms.
      + it preserves identity morphisms i.e $F(\mathbf{1}_{x}) = \mathbf{1}_x$ where $x \in Obj(\mathbf{C})$.
      + it preserves compositions of morphisms i.e the image of composition of morphisms under $F$ is composition of
        their images i.e $F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f)$.
- These functors embed the source category into the target category as they may only cover a part of target category yet
  all objects in the source category must have functor to produce an object in target but the not all objects in the
  target are supposed to be pointed by these functors.
*** Functor Composition
  #+BEGIN_CENTER
 [[../static/draws/functor-comp.png]]
  #+END_CENTER
*** Important Functors
- *Constant Functor* $\Delta_c$ is the functor that maps all the objects from the source category into a single object ($c$) in
  the target category and all the morphisms into a single morphism that is the $\mathbf{1}_c$.
- *BiFunctors* are the functors which map pairs objects and pairs of arrows from $\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{C}$ to
  objects and arrows in $\mathbf{C}$.
- *Contravariant Functors* are the functors from $\mathbf{C}^{op}$ to $\mathbf{C}$ they basically /lift/ the opposite
  arrows.
- *Profunctors* are the functors that go from product of a category and its opposite to the category of sets i.e from
  $\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{C}^{op}$ to *Set*.
- *Representable Functors*
  + We know that morphisms between any two objects ($a,b$) in a category ($\mathbf{C}$) form a set called $\textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}(a,b)$.
    This set also happens to be an object in the category *Set*. We can thus, have a functor (covariant *representable
    functor*) that goes from any category ($\mathbf{C}$) to the category of sets ($\textbf{Set}$) moreover if we fix the source object and vary the target object i.e
    #+BEGIN_CENTER
    $\forall a \in \mathbf{C} \ , \ \textbf{hom}_\mathbf{C}(a,\_) \ : \ \mathbf{C} \to \textbf{Set}$
    #+END_CENTER
    where,
    - $\textbf{hom}_\mathbf{C}(a,b) = \{f \in \mathbf{C} \ | \ f:a\to b\}$ where $b \in \mathbf{C}$.
    - action of this functor on an arrow $g: b \to c$,
      + $\textbf{hom}_\mathbf{C}(a,g) : \textbf{hom}_\mathbf{C}(a,b) \to \textbf{hom}_\mathbf{C}(a,c)$ defines as,
        - $\textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}(a,g) = g \circ f$.
  + As we are fixing the source $a$ the functor $\textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}(a, \_)$ combines all arrows /from/ $a$ to somewhere in $\mathbf{C}$. On the other
    hand, if we were to fix the target $b$ the functor $\textbf{hom_{\mathbf{C}}(\_, b)$ should combine all arrows coming /to/ $b$ since functors
    perserve the source and destination of objects,
    #+BEGIN_CENTER
    $\forall b \in \mathbf{C} \ , \ \textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}(\_,b) \ : \ \mathbf{C}^{op} \to \textbf{Set}$
    #+END_CENTER
    this is a *contra-variant* *representable* functor and is defined as,
    - $\textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}(\_,b) = \_ \circ g'$ where $b \in \mathbf{C}$.
    - action of this functor on some arrow $g' : a' \to a$,
      + $\textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}(g',b) \ : \ \textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}(a,b) \to \textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}(a',b)$ defined as,
        - $\textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}(g',b) = \_ \circ g'$.
  + From above, we can say that $\textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}$ is a *hom-functor*,
    #+BEGIN_CENTER
    $\textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}(\_,\_) \ : \ \mathbf{C}^{op} \times \mathbf{C} \to \textbf{Set}$
    #+END_CENTER
    which maps,
    - a pair of objects $a.b \in \mathbf{C}$ to set $\textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}} (a,b)$ in *Set* category.
    - a pair of morphisms $f,g \in \textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}$, $f: a' \to a$ and $g : b \to b'$ to single morphisms (function) in
      *Set*,
      $\textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}(f,g) : \textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}} (a,b) \to \textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}(a',b')$ defined as $\textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}(f,g) : h \mapsto g \circ h\circ f$.

** Natural Transformations
- When we ask "what are morphisms that preserve this structure?" with mathematical structure under considerations as /functors/ then the
  structure preserving morphisms are called *natural transformations*.
- Given two categories $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ and functors $F : \mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{D}$, $G : \mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{D}$ we define a natural
  transformation as, $\alpha : F \Rightarrow G$ such that,
  + $\alpha$ assigns every object x in $\mathbf{C}$, the arrow $\alpha_x : Fx \to Gx$ in $\mathbf{D}$ such that,
    - any $f : x \to y$ in $\mathbf{C}$ we have, $\alpha_y \circ F(f) = G(f) \circ \alpha_x$.
*** Composition of Natural Transformations
- Consider two fuctors $F,G$ between two categories $\mathbf{C}, \mathbf{D}$ such that a /natural transformation/,
  #+BEGIN_CENTER
  $\alpha : F \to G$
  #+END_CENTER
  is taken to be any rule that takes an object $a \in \mathbf{C}$ and an arrow $\alpha_a : Fa \to Ga$ in a way that the following
  diagram commutes for every arrow $f : a\to b$ where $f \in\mathbf{C}$ ,
  In other words, $Gf \circ \alpha_a = \alpha_b \circ Ff$ for all $f$.
- We can compose natural transformations as depicted visually by the following diagram where we have three functors
  $F,G,H$ between $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{D}$,

  #+attr_html: :width 100px
  #+attr_latex: :width 100px
 [[../static/draws/ntf-comp.png]]
  #+END_CENTER
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
  [[../static/draws/ntf-compo.png]]
   #+END_CENTER
*** Functor Category
- We can now try to make a category of functors as now we can compose two natural transformations to get an arrow
  between two functors.
- Therefore, given two categories $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ the functor category $\mathbf{D}^{\mathbf{C}}$ such that,
  + $\textbf{objects}(\mathbf{D}^{\mathbf{C}}) = \{F \ | \ \text{F is a functor,} \ F : \mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{D}  \}$
  + $\textbf{arrows}(\mathbf{D}^{\mathbf{C}}) = \{\alpha \ | \ \alpha \ \text{is a ntf.} \ \alpha : F \to G  \}$
  + Are the previous two structures sets?
    - No, they're too big to be sets. But we have something better, we can construct a functor category,
      $\textbf{Set}^{\mathbf{C}$} which is the category of all set-valued functors or "/diagrams/" from $\mathbf{C}$ to
      $\textbf{Set}$. This category is not illegitimately big rather it is as big as $\textbf{Set}$ and extremely useful
      as we can embed any category $\mathbf{C}$ into $\textbf{Set}^{\mathbf{C}}$ which comes equipped with advanced category
      theoretic tools which may not present in $\mathbf{C}$. This is possible by using $\textbf{hom-set}$ functor that maps $\mathbf{C}$ into $\textbf{Set}^{\mathbf{C}}$.
**** Natural Isomorphisms
A natural isomorphism is an isomorphism in a functor category. If $F : \mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{D}$ and $G : \mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{D}$ are two functors, a
natural isomorphism between them is a natural transformation $\eta : F \Rightarrow G$ whose components are isomorphisms.
In this case, the inverse natural transformation $\eta^{−1} : G \Rightarrow F$ is given by $(\eta^{-1})_A = (\eta_A)^{-1}$. We write
$F \cong G$ when F and G are naturally isomorphic.
*** Equivalence of Categories
An equivalence ($\simeq$) of categories is a pair of functors, $F$ and $G$ such that,
- $G \circ F = \mathbf{1}_{\mathbf{C}}$
- $F \circ G = \mathbf{1}_{\mathbf{D}}$
** Limits
- According to [[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/][nLab]] ,
  #+BEGIN_CENTER
  "In category theory a limit of a diagram $D:\mathbf{J}\to \mathbf{C}$ in a category $\mathbf{C}$ is an object $Lim_D$ of $\mathbf{C}$
  equipped with morphisms to the objects $Dj$ for all $j\in \mathbf{J}$, such that everything in sight commutes. Moreover, the
  limit $lim_D$ is the universal object with this property, i.e. the “most optimized solution” to the problem of finding
  such an object."
  #+END_CENTER
- Let's try to unpack this definition and generalize this notion of $lim_D$. Consider two categories $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{J}$ with two functors. The objects in $\mathbf{J}$ are indexed $1,2,3\cdots$ thus, objects in $\mathbf{C}$ become $D1,D2,D3\cdots$ and $D$ takes some objects from $\mathbf{J}$ with their morphisms to $\mathbf{C}$. And another collapsing constant functor $\Delta_x$ that collapses all objects into a single object $x$ in $\mathbf{C}$ and all morphisms into the single identity morphism $\mathbf{1}_x$.
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
  [[../static/draws/limd.png]]
   #+END_CENTER
- Two constructions emerge,
  + Cone :
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
  [[../static/draws/cone.png]]
   #+END_CENTER
  + Co-Cone :
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
  [[../static/draws/cocone.png]]
   #+END_CENTER
- Now, let's try to construct a *category of cones* where we want to have beforementioned cones as objects and the unique
  morphism between $LimD$ and $x$ i.e $m$ to be the morphism between cones such that the all the triangles of following  form commute.
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
  [[../static/draws/conecom.png]]
   #+END_CENTER
   The terminal object of this category is called the *limit*.
- Furthermore, we have natural transformations between the two functors $D$ and $\Delta_x$. Since there can be any number
  of such natural transformations they form a $\textbf{hom-set}_{\mathbf{C}^{\mathbf{J}}} (D,\Delta_x)$ in the functor category
  $\mathbf{C}^{\mathbf{J}}$ where $D$ and $\Delta_x$ are just objects. Moreover, this hom-set is also a member of category
  $\textbf{Set}$.
  + For a natural transformation $\alpha : \Delta_x \to D$. We have two hom-sets,
    - One hom-set of natural transformations, $\textbf{hom-set}_{\mathbf{C}^{\mathbf{J}}} (\Delta_x, D)$.
    - One hom-set of the morphisms between apices and limit, $\textbf{hom-set}_{\mathbf{C}} (x, LimD)$.
  + Similarly, we have two functors that go from $\mathbf{C} \to \textbf{Set}$,
    - One functor goes from $x \to \textbf{hom-set}_{\mathbf{C}^{\mathbf{J}}} (\Delta_x, D)$.
    - One functor goes from $x \to hom-set_{\mathbf{C}}(x, LimD)$.
  + We want to show that the morphism (\alpha) between the above hom-sets is a natural transformation.
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
  [[../static/draws/limit.png]]
   #+END_CENTER
- To show that consider natural transformations $\mu$ and $\gamma$ such that,
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
  [[../static/draws/tricom.png]]
   #+END_CENTER
  + $\mu \in \textbf{hom-set}_{\mathbf{C}^{\mathbf{J}}} (\Delta_x, D)$, $\mu_i \ : \ x \to Di$.
  + $\gamma \in \textbf{hom-set}_{\mathbf{C}^{\mathbf{J}}} (\Delta_{x'}, D)$, $\gamma \ : \ x' \to Di$.
  + It is apparent from below diagram that such triangles commute i.e $\gamma_i = \mu_i \circ f$.
- Similarly in *Set*,

   #+BEGIN_CENTER
  [[../static/draws/tricom.png]]
   #+END_CENTER
  + $u \in \textbf{hom-set}_{\mathbf{C}}^{} (x, LimD)$, $u_i \ : \ x \to Di$
  + $v \in \textbf{hom-set}_{\mathbf{C}}^{} (x', LimD)$, $v_i \ : \ x' \to Di$, $v_i = u_i \circ f$
- Therefore for $\alpha$  to be a natural transformation the naturality condition must hold and all such squares must commute.

   #+END_CENTER
** Yoneda Lemma
*** Category of Presheaves
**** Presheaf
A presheaf is a $F: \mathbf{C}^{op} \to \textbf{Set}$ such that for any $x \in \mathbf{C}$, $Fx$ in $\textbf{Set}$ is the set that
represents the /ways/ $x$ can occur in $F$ and any mapping $f: x \to y$ where $f,y \in \mathbf{C}$ the corresponding
$Ff : Fy \to Fx$ maps each of the $y$'s of $Fy$ to each of the $x$'s in $Fx$.
**** Representable Presheaf
The above presheaf $F$ becomes a *representable* when it is naturally isomorphic to a hom-functor $\textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}} (\_ , X) :
\mathbf{C}^{op} \to \textbf{Set}$ which maps any object $c \in \mathbf{C}$ to the hom-set $\textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}} (c , X)$
and each $f : c' \to c$ where $f, c' \in \mathbf{C}$ to the function which maps each morphism $c \to X$ to the composite $(c' \to c) \to
X$. Here the object $X$ is determined uniquely upto an isomorphism in $\mathbf{C}$ and is called the representing object.
**** Yoneda Lemma
  #+BEGIN_CENTER
  "The set of morphisms from a representable presheaf $y(c)$ into an arbitraty presheaf $X$ is in natural bijection with
  the set $X(c)$ assigned by $X$ to the representing object $c$."
  #+END_CENTER
  In simple words if we have a functor $F$ that goes from $\mathbf{C} \to \textbf{Set}$ then the natural transformation between $F$
  and the hom-functor $\textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}} (\_ , c)$ corrosponds by a natural isomorphism (set theoretic bijection) to the set $Fc$.
***** Proof Sketch
- Consider the category of presheaves on a locally small category $\mathbf{C}$ $\textbf{Set}^{\mathbf{C}^{op}}$ with functor,
  #+BEGIN_CENTER
  $y : C \to \textbf{Set}^{\mathbf{C}^{op}} \\ \forall c \in \mathbf{C}, \ y = c \mapsto \textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}}(\_ , c)$
  #+END_CENTER
 $y$ sends each object of $\mathbf{C}$ to the hom-functor into that object i.e presheaf represented by $c$.
- We want to prove that for any $X \in \textbf{Set}^{\mathbf{C}^{op}}$ there is an isomorphism between the hom-set of the
  presheaf functors from $y(c)$ to $X$ and the value of $X$ at $c$.
  #+BEGIN_CENTER
  $\textbf{hom}_{\textbf{Set}^{\mathbf{C}^{op}}}(y(c),X) \cong X(c)$
  #+END_CENTER
- Consider the following diagram,
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
  [[../static/draws/yoneda.png]]
   #+END_CENTER
   Since we know that,
  + $\mathbf{1}_c  \in \textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}} (c,c)$
  + $\eta_c (\mathbf{1}_c) \in X(c)$
  + $f \in \textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}} (b,c)$
  + $\eta_b (f) \in X(b)$
- We can have a similar diagram with elements instead of sets,
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
  [[../static/draws/yonedaelim.png]]
   #+END_CENTER
  From above it is clear that natural transfromation $\eta : \textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}} (\_, c) \Rightarrow X$ is completely
  determined by $\eta_c (\mathbf{1}_c) \in X(c)$. This means that to show naturality condition on any $\eta :
  \textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}} (\_, c) \Rightarrow X$ it is sufficient to show that $\eta$ is already fixed by some value
  $\eta_c(\mathbf{1}_{\mathbf{C}}) \in X(c)$ of its component $\eta_c : \textbf{hom}_{\mathbf{C}} (c,c) \to X(c)$ on $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbf{C}}$.
- In other words, each object of $\mathbf{C}$ is uniquely specified by the arrows into it (or out if it), up to isomorphism. The
  objects of a category can be uniquely defined in terms of the role they play in the category, in terms of their
  interactions with the whole.
