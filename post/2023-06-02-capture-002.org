Hi there,

If you're here, you shouldn't be. This is an unfinished place. The creator is thinking of what to write and how to
write. If you want to read whatever that is, please come back!

If you're still here, look at some beautiful latex.

$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$

$\frac{\sqrt{a^2+4b^2\sin^2\alpha}}{2}$
